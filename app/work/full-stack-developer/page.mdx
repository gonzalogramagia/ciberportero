# Full Stack Developer

## Catsule Corp (2024 – 2025)

### Focus: Full Stack Engineering, System Integrity, and Resilient Deployment | (React, Node.js, Cloud Services)

This role represents my digital identity following my experience in IT Operations, where I transitioned from troubleshooting existing corporate systems to architecting and deploying custom web solutions. This shift provided deep exposure to end-to-end system resilience, security hardening, and operational integrity, key areas for a pivot back into Cybersecurity and advanced IT Support.

(Consulting work focused on high performance and data security during critical campaign traffic spikes.)

**High-Availability Deployment & Resilience:** Engineered and deployed multiple campaign landing pages and informational sites designed for extreme performance and resilience, successfully managing massive traffic surges with zero downtime during high-stakes campaign events.

**Security Through Quality Assurance (QA):** Worked closely with the QA team to identify, document, and proactively mitigate critical defects and potential vulnerabilities across the platform. This involved hardening the application's surface area and ensuring 99.5% software reliability before public deployment.
