# Full Stack Developer

## Catsule Corp (2024 – 2025)

### Focus: Full Stack Engineering, System Integrity, and Resilient Deployment | (React, Node.js, Cloud Services)

This role marked a pivotal shift in my career, moving from IT Operations—where I troubleshot existing corporate systems—to architecting and deploying custom web solutions from scratch. This transition gave me deep, hands-on exposure to end-to-end system resilience, security hardening, and operational integrity—skills that are now fueling my return to Cybersecurity and advanced IT Support.

### Early Projects & Mentorship
My journey into full-stack development started with hands-on mentorship from a senior engineer with over a decade of experience. Before taking on the Alianza project, I cut my teeth on two real-world applications:

*   **Clothing Store Frontend:** Developed the user interface for an e-commerce platform.
*   **Internal Stock & Finance System:** Built a full-stack solution for a used iPhone trading business to manage inventory and finances.

### Key Project: Digital Infrastructure for Alianza La Libertad Avanza de Córdoba
(Consulting work focused on high performance and data security during critical campaign traffic spikes.)

**Building for High Availability:** I engineered and deployed multiple campaign landing pages and informational sites designed to withstand extreme traffic. The goal was simple but critical: zero downtime during high-stakes campaign events, and we delivered.

**Security & QA:** I collaborated closely with the QA team to hunt down and patch critical defects and potential vulnerabilities. We hardened the application's surface area, achieving 99.5% software reliability before the public launch.

**Connecting the Dots:** I handled the full-stack integration, stitching together frontend services with backend APIs. I also fine-tuned server-side logic and optimized the database to ensure data integrity and smooth performance under peak load—experience that directly translates to advanced IT troubleshooting.

**How We Worked:** We operated within an Agile (Scrum/Kanban) framework. I was active in sprint planning and Code Reviews, ensuring we maintained product integrity and enforced secure coding standards every step of the way.
