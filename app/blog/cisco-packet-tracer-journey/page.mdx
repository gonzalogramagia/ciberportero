## Simulating the Real World

I have embarked on a new challenge: building a complete **simulated virtual network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. My goal is to apply the networking concepts I am learning through the **Cisco Networking Academy** courses in a practical, hands-on environment.

This blog post will serve as a living document of my progress, where I will share the topologies I design, the configurations I implement, and the troubleshooting steps I take.

## Why Cisco Packet Tracer?

Packet Tracer is a powerful network simulation tool that allows students to experiment with network behavior and ask "what if" questions. It is an essential tool for anyone preparing for Cisco certifications (like CCNA) or simply wanting to understand how networks operate without the need for expensive physical hardware.

## My Learning Path: Cisco Networking Academy

I am following the official [Cisco Packet Tracer Learning Path](https://www.netacad.com/learning-collections/cisco-packet-tracer?courseLang=en-US) to master network simulation. Here is the roadmap I am committed to completing:

### 1. Getting Started with Cisco Packet Tracer
*   **Duration:** 2 Hours
*   **Goal:** Get familiar with the simulation environment and download the latest version.
*   **Status:** [ ] In Progress

### 2. Exploring Networking with Cisco Packet Tracer
*   **Duration:** 3 Hours
*   **Goal:** Practice using Cisco Packet Tracer to set up, manage, and monitor a branch office network.
*   **Status:** [ ] Pending

### 3. Exploring Internet of Things with Cisco Packet Tracer
*   **Duration:** 3 Hours
*   **Goal:** Learn to add and configure IoT devices in Cisco Packet Tracer to set up a smart home network.
*   **Status:** [ ] Pending

### 4. Introduction to Packet Tracer Exam
*   **Format:** 15 Questions
*   **Goal:** Test knowledge on all three introductory courses and earn a digital badge.
*   **Status:** [ ] Pending

## Updates

*Stay tuned! I will be posting my first network topology and configuration details soon.*
